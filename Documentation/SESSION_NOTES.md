## üö® Critical Information for Next Session

### If You Need to Continue Development:

**The game is FULLY WORKING** - no fixes needed. These are the next logical steps:

1. **Polish & Enhancement** (Optional):
   - Add particle effects for explosions
   - Enhance visual feedback for power-ups
   - Add achievement system
   - Implement high score persistence

2. **Distribution Preparation** (If desired):
   - Add app icons and launch screens
   - Prepare App Store metadata
   - Create marketing screenshots
   - Write App Store description

3. **Code Quality** (Optional):
   - Add unit tests
   - Code documentation improvements
   - Performance profiling

### Critical Context:
- **No urgent fixes needed** - game runs perfectly
- **All major systems complete** - combat, UI, audio, biomes
- **Performance issues resolved** - cached calculations prevent hangs
- **Repository backed up** - all work saved to GitHub
